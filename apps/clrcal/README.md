# Non-dithering Calendar

Based on Calendar app, but uses only discrete colors from the 3 bit palette of Bangle.js 2 to improve legibility and a more crisp look-and-feel. Additionaly this app aims to use localized strings wherever possible.

## Usage

- Use `BTN4` (left screen tap) to go to the previous month
- Use `BTN5` (right screen tap) to go to the next month

## Settings

- Starts on Sunday: whether the calendar should start on Sunday (default is Monday).
